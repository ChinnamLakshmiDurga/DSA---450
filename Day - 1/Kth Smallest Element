Kth smallest element:
Given an array arr[] and an integer K where K is smaller than size of array, the task is to find the Kth smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements are distinct.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 6
arr[] = 7 10 4 3 20 15
K = 3
Output : 7
Explanation :
3rd smallest element in the given 
array is 7.

Approach:
Sort the array using STL function and print the (k-1)th element since array has 0 based indexing.
l-left most index of the array.
r-right most index of the array.

Code:
int kthSmallest(int arr[], int l, int r, int k) {
        r++;
        sort(arr, arr+r);
        return arr[k-1];
 }
